# Abstract
This letter describes and applies generic methods for generating local measures from the correspondencetable. These were developed by integrating the functionality of two existing R packages:gwxtabanddiffeR. They demonstrate how spatially explicit accuracy and error measures can be generated fromlocal geographically weighted correspondence matrices, for example to compare classified and referencedata (predicted and observed) for error analyses, and classes at timest1andt2for change analyses. Theapproaches in this letter extend earlier work that considered the measures derived from correspondencematrices in the context of generalized linear models and probability. Instead the methods computelocal, geographically weighted correspondence matrices, from which local statistic can be calculated. Inthis case a selection of the overall and categorical difference measures proposed by Pontius and Milones(2011) and Pontius and Santacruz (2014), as well as spatially distributed estimates of kappa coefficients,User and Producer accuracies. The discussion reflects on the use of the correspondence matrix inremote sensing research, the philosophical underpinnings oflocalrather thanglobalapproaches formodelling landscape processes and the potential for policy and scientific benefits that local approachessupport.
